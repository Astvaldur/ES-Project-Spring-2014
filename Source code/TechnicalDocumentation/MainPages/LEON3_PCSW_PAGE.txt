/*! \mainpage Soundlie User Interface
 *
 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * The Soundlie user interface has been developed to increase the flexibility of the developed Soundlie effect-unit. \n
 * The user interface makes it possible for the user to alter the system behavior at runtime and monitor events on \n
 * the device. The communication between the device and the user interface use a UART connection and sends and receive \n 
 * data using the modified SREC protocol.
 *
 * \section sec_desc File description
 * File: uart_gui.sln \n
 * Project file used to open the Soundlie User Interface project
 * 
 * File: Soundlie_GUI.cs [design] \n
 * Contains the layout of the user interface. 
 * 
 * File: Soundlie_GUI.cs \n
 * Contains the source code for all events and all functions developed.
 *
 *
 * \section sec_desc2 Installation
 * The user interface have been developed in Visual Studio C#.\n
 * The user interface use the MATLAB COM objec MLAPP to perform the filter coefficient calculations.
 *
 * \subsection sec_desc3 Register the MATLAB COM object
 * In order to be able to use the access the COM object, and get the user interface to work properly, the following steps need to be taken.
 * 
 * \subsubsection sec_desc4 Step 1: In MATLAB the COM object need to be registered.
 * Run the following command in the MATLAB command window (administrator mode): \n
 * >> !matlab -regserver
 * 
 * \subsubsection sec_desc5 Step 2: In Visual Studio the COM object need to be added as a reference.
 * From Visual Studio, add a reference to the MATLAB COM object. \n
 * In Microsoft Visual Studio, open your project. From the Project menu, select Add Reference. Select the COM tab in the Add Reference dialog box. \n
 * Select the MATLAB application.

 * \subsubsection sec_desc6 Step 3: Access the COM object
 * The MATLAB com object is accessed in the code using the following command (This step is already implmented in the code).
 * MLApp.MLApp matlab = new MLApp.MLApp();
 *
 * \section sec_desc7 System requirement 
 * The Soundlie user inteface have been developed using the following software \n
 * MATLAB Version: 8.3.0.532 (R2014a) \n
 * Visual Studio Ultimate 2012 \n
 * Microsoft Visual C# 2012 \n
 * Microsoft Windows 7 Professional  Version 6.1 (Build 7601: Service Pack 1)
