The test bench designed in ModelSim is designed to take the PWM module as a component.
For testing samples generated by a script is used.

The samples are loaded into a memory array in the test bench. Each PWM
period a new sample will be loaded just before so it can be used
by the PWM component to create the PWM signal for the new PWM period

The test bench will also use the sample and create a reference 
PWM signal that is used to compare with the PWM components PWM signal. 
If the component is working as intended these two signals will be identical.

The testbench is scalable in the amount of samples it can load in
and also the bit size of the sample just like the component.

NOTE!:
Because of reset the first cycle will not have the correct pwm.
I have not fixed this yet.
